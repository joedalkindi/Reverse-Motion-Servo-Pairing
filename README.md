# Reverse Motion Servo Pairing

This project demonstrates how to pair two servos to move in reverse motion relative to each other.

## Description

The goal is to control a pair of servos such that when one servo moves in one direction, the other moves in the opposite direction. This is useful for applications like robotic arms, grippers, or mechanisms requiring synchronized reverse movement.

## Features

- Simple control of two servos
- Reverse motion synchronization
- Easy to integrate with Arduino or other microcontrollers

## Usage

1. Connect the two servos to your microcontroller.
2. Upload the provided code to control the servo motions.
3. Adjust servo angles as needed to fit your mechanical setup.

## Requirements

- Arduino board (or compatible microcontroller)
- Two servo motors
- Arduino IDE for uploading the code

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the sketch to your board.
